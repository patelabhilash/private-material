### Action to be taken on the topic-webpage

1. Look for ALL **step wise explanations** in the page.
For each step wise explanation :  click maximize then (+).  Take separate screenshot of  the explanation. click (-) , then minimize.
2. Look for ALL **show hint** and ONE **show solution**. Click on each "show hint", click on "show solution" , then "no just show solution". take screenshot.

So total no. of screenshots = no. of step wise explanation + 1 (which is the same page u are on) .

3. Look for ALL **black-background texts**. For each black-background texts : copy texts, create new file named "1.txt". paste and save it. 
Files should be saved as the order they appear in the topic webpage. File names be like : 1.txt, 2.txt. 3.txt etc.

So total no. of txt files = no. of black-background texts in the same page u are on.

_**So total no. of files in a topic folder = no. of screenshots +  no. of black-background texts**_
